* Labo preparation checklist *

Problem: we need the MAC addresses (both Wi-Fi and Ethernet) to connect all
the Pi's to a router. The only way to get them is to connect each Pi, one by
one (with a master labo image on its SD), on a router and check the "attached
devices". Addresses are recorded in file `Raspberry-install-md`.

* Meta preparation

This is an Emacs Org's file. Before starting a new whole lab preparation,
reset all the TODO and CHECK lists!

* TODO Install the latest labo image
- [X] Download latest Raspbian Pi OS image (with GUI desktop; not NOOBS!)
- [X] Tweak the original Raspbian Pi OS image (see `Raspberry-install-md`)

- [X] Dump the final labo image (master) from SD onto HD =>
  `raspios_Labo-IoT.YYYY-MM-DD.img`
- [X] Clone the master image onto the other SD cards: (WIP: how to do with
  Ansible or Docker, instead?)
